Software
-----------------------------
* Gameplay
	* Think about and implement coop scoring. Both players should get points towards their total during coop. How should we handle score display at that time?
	* Negative sounds?
	* Release particles at the end of the game

* Visual
	* Meta balls/Liquid/Coolness
	* Merge should work forever by summing particles size and getting bigger and bigger ....
	* Merge should be prox based

* Logger with enablable println and warnings

* Code style/Nitpicks
	* Can HUD be cleaned up

	* Provide more robust behavior for variable quantity objects (Gloves, Patches, Xbees, Levels, etc)
	* Provide meaning full null error messages throughout 

	* if/switch/catch/for/while
	* Standard constructor arg ordering

Firmware/Patch/Glove Control
-----------------------------
* Graceful fail (duty 0)
* alt send mechanism (everything 5 times a sec?)
* "Drop" patch if it hasn't been seen in a certain amount of time (to avoid points when patches spaz out)

Hardware
-----------------------------
* Could the red/prox issue be due to current draw issues
* XBee stress test
* Fix Glove charger

Playtest
-----------------------------
* Sounds for particles
* Coop

* Single zone
* Boppers
* Health
